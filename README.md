# collision_detection
I test several ways for 2d collision detection by using the SFML framework

The first method will check the collision of each ball with all others and the walls. The second method uses a gridded floor for dividing the whole ground into several sectors. On each sector its own collission detection will be performed, with consideration of adjacent sectors.
